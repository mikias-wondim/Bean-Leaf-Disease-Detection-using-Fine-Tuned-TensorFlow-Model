# Bean Leaf Disease Detection using Fine-Tuned TensorFlow Model

## Introduction
Bean plants are susceptible to various diseases that can significantly impact yields and economic productivity. Early and accurate detection of these diseases is crucial for effective management. In this project, we develop a deep learning model for bean plant disease detection using fine-tuning techniques.

## Project Highlights
- **Objective**: Detect bean leaf diseases using deep learning.
- **Model**: Fine-tuned pre-trained model (i.e. EfficientNetB0 and ResNet50V2)).
- **Dataset**: Bean leaf images (healthy and diseased).
- **Accuracy**: Impressive accuracy of approximately **97%**.

## Steps
1. **Data Collection and Preparation**:
   - Collect a dataset of bean leaf images.
   - Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Fine-Tuning**:
   - Use a pre-trained model as a base.
   - Replace the classification head for bean disease detection.
   - Fine-tune the model on the bean leaf dataset.

3. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Apply image augmentations (rotation, flip, zoom) for robustness.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the fine-tuned model on the test set.
   - Achieve an impressive accuracy of above 85%.

5. **Export Model**:
   - Export the model to TensorFlow Lite format.
   - Deploy in your application for real-world use.

## Example Code (Python)
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Load pre-trained ResNet50 model
base_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)

# Add custom classification head
x = base_model.output
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
predictions = Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)

# Create the fine-tuned model
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Fine-tune on bean leaf dataset
model.fit(train_data, epochs=10, validation_data=val_data)

# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_data)
print(f"Test accuracy: {test_acc:.2f}")

# Export to TensorFlow Lite
model.export(export_dir='bean_disease_model.tflite', format=ExportFormat.TFLITE)
```

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-tuning pre-trained models for bean leaf disease detection. With an impressive accuracy of approximately 97%, our model can aid farmers in timely disease management.
