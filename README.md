# Bean-Leaf-Disease-Detection-using-Fine-Tuned-TensorFlow-Model
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for bean plant disease detection using fine-tuning. Fine-tuning is a technique that allows us to take a pre-trained model that has been trained on a large dataset and adapt it to a new task with a smaller dataset.
